I am using the Excel spreadsheet and it's tools to create a table containing twenty rows of data fields containing employees full names, salaries, and job descriptions. The 'filter tool' will be extensively used to perform tasks like splitting full names, streamlining the salary scale above a certain range, and determining the highest and lowest salary.
