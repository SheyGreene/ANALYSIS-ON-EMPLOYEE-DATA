# TASK 1

# **INTRODUCTION**

I am using the Excel spreadsheet and it's tools to create a table containing twenty rows of data fields containing employees full names, salaries, and job descriptions. The 'filter tool' will be extensively used to perform tasks like splitting full names, streamlining the salary scale above a certain range, and determining the highest and lowest salary.

# **ACTIVITY**
1. To create a table with 20 rows and 5 columns of Employee ID, Employee Fullname, Department, Salary and Job Type
2. Show employees who are freelancers and highlight salary above $10,000
3. Split employees' full names into first name and last name and highlight any duplicates found.
4. Highlight employees whose names begin with the letter 'E' in yellow and highlight the highest salary with a green background and the lowest salary with a red background.

# **SKILLS DEMONSTRATED**
1. Data Processing
2. Use of Filter Function
3. Use of Text-to-Column
4. Conditinal Formatting Tool Used: Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet
